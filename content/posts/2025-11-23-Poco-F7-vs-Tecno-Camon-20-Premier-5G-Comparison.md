## Design and Build Quality

### Poco F7

**Design Philosophy:**
The Poco F7 features a dual-tone design that's both modern and distinctive.

**Key Specs:**

-   6.83-inch display
-   IP69 rating (dust and water protection)
-   Vapor cooling system
-   Premium feel despite competitive pricing

**Real-World Experience:**
The IP69 rating makes this phone incredibly durable. I've used it in Bhubaneswar's monsoon season without any worry. The larger 6.83-inch screen is excellent for media consumption and multitasking.

### Tecno Camon 20 Premier 5G

**Design Philosophy:**
Sleek and stylish with focus on ergonomics.

**Key Specs:**

-   6.67-inch AMOLED display
-   IP53 rating (dust and splash protection)

**Real-World Experience:**
The smaller form factor makes it easier to use one-handed. The IP53 rating offers basic protection, sufficient for everyday use but not as robust as Poco F7's IP69.
